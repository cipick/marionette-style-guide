# Marionette + Backbone Style Guide

This style guide for Marionette and Backbone was written so that our development team would be on the same page for coding standards, best practices, patterns and anti-patterns when writing Marionette apps in CoffeeScript, especially since there was no formal style guide for Marionette app development.

It is made available to the developer community for sharing and improvement. Contribution is welcome and encouraged.

## CoffeeScript

We use CoffeeScript for writing our code, instead of vanilla JavaScript, allowing us to focus our attention on problem-solving.

This document does not define a style guide for CoffeeScript itself, as there are plenty of good ones already written. Use [polarmobile's CoffeeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide) for reference.
